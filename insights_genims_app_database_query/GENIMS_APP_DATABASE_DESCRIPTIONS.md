## 1. GENIMS_MASTER_DB

The foundational database serving as the single source of truth for all enterprise master data across the GenIMS (Generative Industrial Managed Services) ecosystem. Contains multi-factory operations data, including factory locations with certifications and capacity, production infrastructure hierarchy (production lines, machines with criticality levels, sensors collecting 10+ measurement types), human resources (employees with roles and certifications), product portfolios (bill of materials, cycle times, quality targets), and customer information (types, volumes, SLA requirements). The data model uses a hierarchical star schema centered on factories: Factories → Production Lines → Machines → Sensors creates a parent-child hierarchy, while line_product_mapping and customer_product_mapping establish many-to-many relationships with line-specific metrics (cycle times, yields) and customer parameters (pricing, volumes, quality requirements). The database maintains referential integrity through foreign key constraints and optimizes query performance with cascading indices on common joins. Serves as the bootstrap data source, ensuring data consistency and enabling seamless enterprise-wide integration across all 13 operational systems.

Functions as the canonical Master Data Management (MDM) hub that establishes dimensional conformity across the entire GenIMS ecosystem. Every transactional system references MASTER_DB entities through standardized foreign key relationships, ensuring consistent dimensional context for analytics, reporting, and business intelligence. The factory-centric hierarchy enables drill-down analysis from enterprise-level KPIs to machine-specific performance metrics. Product-line associations support manufacturing feasibility analysis, capacity planning, and changeover optimization. Customer-product relationships enable customer-specific quality requirements, pricing structures, and delivery commitments to flow through manufacturing execution. Employee-skill mappings ensure proper workforce allocation and competency tracking across production operations. The database schema design supports both operational queries (real-time lookups for transaction processing) and analytical workloads (dimensional modeling for business intelligence), with optimized indexing strategies for hierarchical traversal and cross-reference joins. Critical for maintaining data lineage, audit trails, and regulatory compliance across manufacturing, quality, financial, and customer management processes. Enables enterprise-wide standardization of naming conventions, classification schemes, and business rules that cascade through all downstream operational databases.

## 13. GENIMS_QUALITY_DB

Quality Management System implementing enterprise-wide quality control, compliance, and continuous improvement. Quality audits (9 audits) assess manufacturing process compliance with internal standards and customer requirements, discovering 9 audit findings. Quality documents (20 documents) maintain control plans, work instructions, test methods, and acceptance criteria. Quality KPIs (90 metrics) track leading indicators: incoming inspection pass rates, process capability (Cpk/Ppk), first-pass yield, defect rates (ppm), by product, line, and supplier. Non-conformance Reports (69 NCR headers with 36 defect details) document quality deviations, root cause analysis, and corrective actions. CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) management (13 CAPA headers with 42 action items) drives closure of NCRs with systemic improvements. Control plans (20 plans with 54 characteristics) define manufacturing operations, control points, and acceptance criteria by product. Supplier quality metrics (19 metrics by supplier) track incoming material quality: defect rates, on-time delivery, documentation completeness. Calibration management (30 measuring instruments with 90 calibration records) ensures measurement system accuracy with 3-year audit trail (3 alerts for calibration overdue). SPC (Statistical Process Control) charts (15 control charts with 517 data points) monitor process stability and trend detection. PPAP (Production Part Approval Process) submissions (10 submissions) track supplier approval of production parts with dimensional data, material certs, and initial run data. Eight-D reports (5 reports) formalize customer complaint investigation and resolution. Integration: receives defect data from Manufacturing_DB (quality inspections), sends quality metrics to CRM for customer visibility, links to Supplier_DB for supplier CAPA tracking. Compliance: automotive (IATF 16949), pharmaceutical (FDA 21 CFR Part 11), general (ISO 9001). Analytics: process capability by line/product, defect Pareto charts, supplier performance trending.

Serves as the comprehensive quality excellence orchestrator transforming quality management from reactive defect detection into predictive quality assurance and continuous improvement culture throughout the manufacturing enterprise. The statistical process control framework leverages real-time data from OPERATIONS_DB sensor networks to detect process variations before they result in defects, enabling proactive process adjustments and preventing customer quality issues. Advanced analytics engine correlates quality data across multiple dimensions including material lots, machine performance, environmental conditions, and operator performance to identify root causes and predict quality risks. The CAPA management system creates systematic problem-solving workflows that drive permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes, building organizational learning and preventing recurrence of quality issues. Supplier quality management integrates incoming inspection data, supplier audits, and performance metrics to drive supplier development and ensure consistent incoming material quality that supports overall product quality objectives. Document control and training management ensure all personnel have access to current procedures, work instructions, and quality requirements while maintaining complete audit trails for regulatory compliance. Measurement system analysis and calibration management maintain measurement accuracy and precision essential for reliable quality data and regulatory compliance. Customer complaint management system creates closed-loop feedback where customer issues trigger systematic investigation, corrective action, and process improvements. Integration with MANUFACTURING_DB production data enables real-time quality monitoring and automatic quality holds when process parameters exceed control limits. The quality cost tracking system quantifies the cost of quality including prevention, appraisal, internal failure, and external failure costs enabling data-driven quality investment decisions and continuous improvement prioritization. Regulatory compliance framework ensures adherence to industry standards and regulations while maintaining readiness for customer audits and regulatory inspections.
